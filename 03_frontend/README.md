# Phase 3: Frontend Development — The User's Experience

## 🌱 Purpose

Frontend development is about creating the interface users interact with. While backend handles logic and data, frontend handles:
- Visual presentation
- User interactions
- Client-side logic
- Communication with backend APIs

**Why This Matters**: As a full-stack developer, you need to understand:
- How frontend and backend communicate
- How to build user interfaces
- How to handle user interactions
- How to consume APIs from the frontend

**This Section Focuses On**:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals
- How frontend communicates with Python backends
- Modern frontend frameworks (understanding their role)
- Building complete user interfaces

## 📚 Learning Path

### 1. HTML: Structure
The foundation — how web pages are structured.

### 2. CSS: Styling
Making pages look good — layout, colors, typography.

### 3. JavaScript: Interactivity
Adding behavior — handling clicks, making API calls, dynamic content.

### 4. Frontend-Backend Integration
How JavaScript communicates with your Python backend.

### 5. Modern Frameworks (Overview)
Understanding React, Vue, and how they work with Python backends.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you'll understand:

- How HTML structures web pages
- How CSS styles pages
- How JavaScript adds interactivity
- How to make API calls from JavaScript
- How frontend and backend work together
- When to use frontend frameworks

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with `fundamentals/html_css_js.md` to learn the basics. Then explore `integration/` to see how frontend connects to your Python backend.

## 💡 Reflection Questions

As you progress, consider:

1. How does the frontend request data from the backend?
2. What happens when a user clicks a button?
3. How do modern frameworks simplify frontend development?
4. How does your QA background help you test frontend functionality?
5. What's the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering?
