# Phase 1: Foundations — Understanding the Web Ecosystem

## 🌱 Purpose

Before building web applications, we must understand *how* the web actually works. This phase establishes the mental models that will guide everything else you learn.

**Why this matters**: Without understanding the fundamentals, you'll be following recipes without knowing why they work. With deep understanding, you can solve problems creatively and debug effectively.

## 📚 Learning Path

### 1. Web Fundamentals
Understanding the request-response cycle, HTTP protocol, and how browsers communicate with servers.

### 2. Networking Deep Dive
TCP/IP, DNS, how data travels across the internet, and security fundamentals.

### 3. API Concepts
Understanding APIs as contracts between systems, REST principles, and modern API design.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you'll understand:

- How a URL becomes a web page (the complete journey)
- What happens when you click a link or submit a form
- How HTTP requests and responses work
- How DNS translates domain names to IP addresses
- How TCP/IP ensures reliable data transmission
- How APIs enable different systems to communicate
- The security implications of web communication

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with `web_fundamentals/README.md` and work through each section sequentially. Each section builds on the previous one.

## 💡 Reflection Questions

As you progress, consider:

1. How does understanding the request-response cycle help you debug web applications?
2. Why do we need protocols like HTTP? What problems do they solve?
3. How does your QA background help you understand the complete flow of a web request?
4. What happens when something goes wrong? How can you trace the problem?

*"Understanding the foundation is not about memorizing protocols — it's about seeing the patterns that make the web work."*
