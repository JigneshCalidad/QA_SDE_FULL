# Phase 5: Production & Operations

## 🌱 Purpose

Building applications is one thing. Deploying them to production, monitoring them, and keeping them running is another. This phase covers:
- Containerization (Docker)
- Deployment strategies
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and logging
- Server management

**Why This Matters**: Understanding production operations helps you:
- Deploy applications reliably
- Monitor application health
- Debug production issues
- Scale applications
- Work with DevOps teams

## 📚 Learning Path

### 1. Docker: Containerization
Package your application and its dependencies into containers.

### 2. Deployment: Making It Live
Deploy applications to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.).

### 3. CI/CD: Continuous Integration/Deployment
Automate testing and deployment.

### 4. Monitoring: Understanding Application Health
Monitor applications in production.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you'll understand:

- How to containerize applications
- How to deploy to production
- How to set up CI/CD pipelines
- How to monitor applications
- How to debug production issues

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with `devops/docker.md` to learn containerization. Then explore deployment options.

---

## 💡 Reflection Questions

As you progress, consider:

1. What's the difference between development and production?
2. Why is containerization valuable?
3. How does CI/CD improve development workflow?
4. How do you debug issues in production?
5. How does your QA background help you understand production systems?

*"Production is where your code meets reality. Understanding operations helps you build applications that work in the real world."*
